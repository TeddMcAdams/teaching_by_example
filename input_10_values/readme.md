Write a program that inputs a series of positive values (up to 10). A negative value indicates the end of the list and is not included in the calculations. If the user enters in more than 10 positive values before the negative value, output an error message and stop. Otherwise (with the 10 or fewer positive values entered) output the arithmetic mean, variance and standard deviation.
